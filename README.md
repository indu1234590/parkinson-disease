MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH
In this project, various machine learning algorithms are employed to build a predictive model for detecting Parkinson's Disease based on the voice measurements provided in the dataset. The steps involved include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.
