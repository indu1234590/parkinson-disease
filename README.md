# Parkinson's Disease Detection using Machine Learning

## Machine Learning Approach

In this project, various machine learning algorithms are employed to build a predictive model for detecting Parkinson's Disease based on the voice measurements provided in the dataset. The steps involved include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

## Algorithms Used

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting



## ðŸš€ How to Use
